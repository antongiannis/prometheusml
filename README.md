## Install PrometheusML
Install Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span> on Docker Swarm with the cloud native Docker Compose tool. 
You need to follow the next steps.

**_Important consideration_**. The default Docker Compose configuration is not intended for production. It creates 
a proof of concept (PoC) implementation where all Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span> services are placed 
into a cluster.

### 1. Environment setup
Before proceeding to using Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span>, you need to prepare your environment.

You need to have Docker Compose **installed** on your computer. Docker Compose relies on Docker Engine, 
so make sure you have Docker Engine installed either locally or remote, depending on your setup. More details on how 
to install it can be found in the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### 2. Clone repository
```sh 
git clone https://gitlab.com/yailab/prometheusml.git
```

### 3. Launch PrometheusML
Go to the cloned repository folder, and type the following commands:

```sh
# Set needed environment variable(s)
export gl_username="yailab" prometheus_dir="/home/prometheus/prometheusml" 
# Run the containers and bind your local repo to them
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

You can now access Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span> from the browser of your choice 
by typing the address `localhost:5000`. 

You can create **a new user** by going to the registration page of your locally launched 
Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span> instance. The created user comes preloaded 
with two **templates**, a general _regression_ and a _classification_ one. You can now 
<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">enjoy building machine learning models</span>!


## Documentation
The documentation of Prometheus<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">ML</span> is under 
<span style="color: #ff7F2a;">active development</span>! 

You can start with the following **tutorial videos** for a quick introduction:
- [Using PrometheusML to predict ...]()
- [Using PrometheusML to classify ...]()
